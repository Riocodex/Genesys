This code defines a Telephone class with the required methods: addPhoneNumber, removePhoneNumber, and dialPhoneNumber. The class also uses the observer pattern to notify observers when a phone number is dialed. The Observer class is also defined with a method onDial that will be called when the telephone notifies the observer. Two instances of the observer class are created, one with the name 'printNumber' and the other with the name 'printMessage' respectively, and added to the telephone class. The code also demonstrates how to use the classes by adding a phone number, and dialing it, which will notify the observers and print the dialed number.
