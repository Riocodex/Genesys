## JAVASCRIPT
## WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is the lingua franca of the Web.
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language as well as a server-side scripting language. 
This scripting language can be written into HTML pages (also could use CSS for styling the pages), and web browsers understand the page.
This scripting language also acts like an object-oriented programming language but not a class-based object-oriented language.

## CORE FEATURES

## 1.  Object-Centered Script Language
Object Centered Language features built in the object as Java Script has a window object. Some Common Examples of Object Centered languages are Java Script and Visual Basic etc. The object-centered languages are mostly used for features like Polymorphism which is a quality of taking an object in many forms. Use of Polymorphism within object-oriented programming requires whenever we use to represent reference of the parent class to an object of a child class.

## 2.  Client Edge Technology
The client is basically a term used for Web Browser in respective of User. The data on the server gets uploaded by a client which later used by a user in the rendered form. The user gets access to the client through a web browser for surfing and interacting through websites. The client edge technology in Java Script allows the client to have full control over the content which is being updated in servers.

## 3.  Validation of User’s Input
Validation of User’s Input is most commonly known as form validation, it allows users to interact with client through filling forms through web pages. The details in the form need to be correctly filled where form validation helps the client to validate the details entered by the user.

## 4. Else and IF Statement
IF and Else Statements are used to perform logical operations.

## 5. Interpreter Centered
Java Script is built with Interpreter Centered which allows the user to get the output without the use of Compiler. That means the input performed by the user gets rendered directly without the compiling of codes.

## 6. Ability to Perform In Build Function
Java Script has many In-Built Functions like isNAN (), Number (), parseFloat () and parseInt () etc. isNAN () Function is used to identify that input object is correct number format. parseFloat () function is used in the conversion of the object into a number. parseInt () Function is used to analyze strings.

## 7. Case Sensitive Format
The codes written in Java Script are Case Sensitive which explains that there will be no difference in the output whether the codes are written in Upper Case or Lower Case Format.

## 8. Light Weight and delicate
Java Script Features Light Weight and delicate and codes written in JavaScript don’t include variables and uses only objects to perform the operations. 

## 9. Statements Looping
The statement looping is used to perform the same operations repeatedly. In this operation the same set of code run in repeat manner for a specific or unspecific set of time.

## 10. Handling Events
The Java Script has the ability to control operations updated on servers. This is basically controlling the response on the website when the user tries to perform any operation the server handled by the client like clicking on links and options, interaction response over the website, etc.
