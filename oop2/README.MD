## OOP TASK DESCRIPTION
## ANIMAL PROPERTIES
I first put the properties of animals which were listed in the diagram inside an abstract class named AnimalProperties.I made it abstract because its not meant to be instantiated directly.
I make each properties a function..an encapsulated function.

## OTHER CLASSES
Then i create different classes of the species of animals like aves,mammals,reptiles etc to inherit the animal properties and call the function to change the property..ie if bird is warm blooded it calls the Animal properties class and overrides the property.This also applies to if an animal has a vertebrae or not.

## INSTANTIATING
I instantiate the remaining classes with animals similar to the drawing and console.log the results.
Enjoy!!!
